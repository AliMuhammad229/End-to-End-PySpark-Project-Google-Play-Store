# End to End PySpark Google Play Store Project

### Overview
This project demonstrates an End to End Data Pipeline using PySpark in the Databricks Community Edition to process and analyze a dataset related to the Google Play Store. The dataset used is an Excel file, which is directly uploaded to the Databricks environment, and transformations are performed using PySpark to clean, process, and extract insights from the data.

### Tools & Technologies
  - Databricks Community Edition: Used for data processing and analysis.
  - PySpark: The primary language for data transformation and manipulation.
  - pandas: Used for reading the Excel file.
  - Spark DataFrames: For scalable and efficient data transformations.

### How to Run
 - Clone the repository or upload the necessary scripts to your Databricks workspace.
 - Upload the dataset:
    - Navigate to Databricks File Store.
    - Upload the Excel file of the Google Play Store dataset.
 - Run the notebooks: Execute each notebook sequentially to ingest, clean, transform, and analyze the data.
